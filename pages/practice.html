    <hr style="border: bisque"><p>
        Tacheometry is a branch of angular surveying in which both the horizontal and vertical distances of points are <br>
        obtained by optical means as opposed to the ordinary slower process of measurement by tape or chain. <br>
        In this method, measurements by tape or chain is completely dispensed with horizontal distances obtained by <br>
        <a href="https://www.google.com">tacheometry observations</a> do not require <a href="https://www.google.com">slope correction</a><br>
        ,<a href="https://www.google.com">tension correction</a> etc. This method is very rapid and convenient. It is the best <br>
        adopted in obstacles such as steep and broken ground, deep revines, stretches of water or swamp and so on, which <br>
        make chaining difficult or impossible.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: black; font-family: monospace;font-size: 20px">PURPOSE OF TACHEOMETRIC SURVEYING</h2><p>
      The primary object of tacheometry is the <em style="color: coral">preparation</em> of <ins>contoured</ins> maps or plans. <br>
      It is considered to be rapid and accurate in rough country and country and has thus been widely used by engineers in the location <br>
      survey for railway,canals, reservoirs,etc. <br>
      Whenever survey of higher accuracy are carried out,<mark>tacheometry provides a good check on distances measured with
    a tape or chain.</mark>

     Before we continue in this lecture can you kindly solve this problem;
     <p>
         Try reading this sentence correctly within 10 seconds;

     Alright we can continue
       <h4 style="color: black;font-size: 20px;font-family: monospace">LOCAL ATTRACTION</h4>
        <p>
            North end of a freely suspended magnetic needle always points to the magnetic north, if it is not <br>
            influenced by any other external forces except the earth magnetic field. It is common experience that <br>
            the magnetic needle gets deflected from its normal position if placed near magnetic rocks, iron ores, <br>
            cables carrying current or electric poles, such a disturbing force is known as <em style="font-family: sans-serif;font-size:15px ">LOCAL ATTRACTION</em>. <strong>For more details on Local Attraction</strong><a href="https://www.google.com">
            <button style="background-color: peru; color: papayawhip;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif">CLICK HERE</button></a> <br>
            The presence of local attraction in any station may be detected by observing the <a href="https://www.waptrick.com">FB</a> and <a href="https://www.waptrick.com">BB</a> of the line. <br>
            <ins>
                If the difference between FB and BB is 180degrees, both stations are free from local attraction.
            </ins><br>
            If not the discrepancy may be due to the following;
            <div class="discrepancy"><p>
                An error in the observations of either FB or BB or both
            </p>

            <div class="discrepancy">
                <p>
